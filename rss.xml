            <description><![CDATA[<p>My biggest disappointment in modern civilization is the destruction of any kind of American culture by our corporate system. To see this first hand, just look at where we shop. I remember the day when one knew the merchants that we purchased our goods from. I always enjoyed chatting with our local grocer when my family made its weekly pilgrimage to Delpino’s groceries to procure our share of American agricultural abundance. In the summer, the vegetables would come from local truck farmers. We would pass our future meat on the road to town. The shops where we spent our money were owned by the people who waited on you. There was an excellence in service, a quality of goods and a pleasure in the experience which cannot be matched in a mall. We all buy our clothes from the same haberdashery run by a suit in some far off office building. Every American mall is populated by the same ticky tack stores. One nation under one brand for all.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>CONSERVATIVES AND LIBERALS VERSUS INDIVIDUALS</h1><p>By the way conservatives and liberals attack each other with the same verbiage over and over, you would think that they each held wildly divergent views. Nothing could be farther from the truth. They both cling to the government like some raggedy ass old teddy bear. Conservatives chatter again and again, like psycho Chicken Littles, about the socialist takeover of our government. Liberals are very fond of painting their counterparts as bigots and fascists of the highest order. Now, admittedly, there is a modicum of truth in almost anything that a human utters. However, small truths do not make great ideas. Looking deeper into conservative and liberal political history shows that they are swinging the same hammer from a different angle. That hammer is the government. The nail is the individual.</p></article>]]></description>
